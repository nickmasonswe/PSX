#Declare 2 variables "x" & "y", and set their values to any number you like. Next declare a variable "solution" which uses Python's formatted string literal implementation (also known as f-string)that prints the correct output to the console.

#finish the f-string below:
#printf()
#should print The sum of <x> + <y> = <x+y> => ie "The sum of 2 + 4 = 6" when printing solution
