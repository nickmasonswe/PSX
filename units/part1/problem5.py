Credit to CSX, read about escape sequences when writing strings:

Anytime JavaScript (or Python) sees a (\) inside of a string, it knows that the following character has a special meaning. Here is a list of some of the most common escape sequences:

    \' => single quote
    \" => double quote
    \\ => backslash
    \n => newline
    \r => carriage return
    \t => tab
    \b => backspace
    \f => form feed

Notice that even a backslash itself has to be escaped in order to display inside a string as well. Now let's see what you can do!
